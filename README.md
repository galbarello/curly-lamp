## Install

Clone this repository, and in the new directory, run:

    npm install
    node server.js

This will run a Node server on `localhost:3000` that you can visit in
your browser.

## Structure

`server.js` in the root directory is the Node server that features
very simple token-based authentication. 

## Task

Create a front end application (using the tools you like, or think will be a good fit for the project)
